# Notes

## Basic Info

- Yukihiro Matsumoto, commonly known as 'Matz' created the Ruby language in 1993

- the principle of least surprise

- Parentheses are usually optional with a method call

- In Ruby, everything from an integer to a string is considered to be an object

- each object has built in 'methods' 

- Ruby is dot notation

- Some methods such as puts and gets are available everywhere

- Java and C programmers - no need to write a main method/function

- String literals are sequences of characters between single or double quotation marks.

- Ruby is an interpreted language, so you don't have to recompile to execute the program written in Ruby

- The Ruby coding convention states that file/directory name is lower case of class/module name with .rb extension. For example, Foo class has name foo.rb

## Features

- Free format - You can start writing your program from any line and column.

- Case sensitive

- Comments : # single line. =start ... =end multiline

- Statement delimiters: new line and ; . '\' escape character

- Keywords :

  - everything is true except the reserved words false and nil

  - Keywords would be called "reserved words"

  - if you prefix these keywords with @, @@ or $ prefixes, or sigils, and use them as instance, class or global variable names, respectively.

  - Keywords resource: http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/doc/keywords_rdoc.html

- Arithmatic output date type is determined by input types int in, int out. dec. in, dec. out.

- The sign of the result (for % operator) is always the same as the sign of the second operand.

- you can write a Boolean expression such as the following that assigns values to variables until it encounters a false value:

  - if a = f(x) and b = f(y) and c = f(z) then d = g(a,b,c) end
